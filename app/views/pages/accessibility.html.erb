<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement for GOV.UK Forms</h1>

<p>This accessibility statement applies to the:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>GOV.UK Forms website at <a href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk">https://www.forms.service.gov.uk</a></li>
  <li>GOV.UK Forms platform at <a href="https://admin.forms.service.gov.uk">https://admin.forms.service.gov.uk</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a separate accessibility statement for online forms created using the platform - that statement is linked to from individual forms.</p>

<p>There’s also a separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility-statement">accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website</a>.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using the website and platform</h2>

<p>The website and platform are run by GDS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use them. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
  <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
  <li>navigate most of the website and platform using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
  <li>listen to most of the website and platform using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve also made the text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible the website and platform are</h2>

<p>We know that some parts of the platform are not yet fully accessible - these issues are mainly to do with the sign in page. People with visual impairments may find it harder to navigate this page, as described under the heading ‘Non-accessible content’.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Feedback and contact information</h2>

<p>We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of the website and platform.</p>

<p>If you find any problems not listed on this page, or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, email us at <a href="mailto:govuk-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">govuk-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

<p>The following content on the platform is not compliant with the WCAG 2.2 level AA standard.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Issues affecting the Auth0 sign in page</h4>

<p>There’s a lack of contrast between the ‘Continue’ button’s outline and its background. This could make it harder to navigate the page if you have a visual impairment. This does not meet <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">success criterion 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast)</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a lack of contrast between the ‘Create an account’ link text and its background. This could make it harder to navigate the page if you have a visual impairment affecting how you perceive colour. This does not meet <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html">success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast (Minimum))</a>.</p>

<p>When an error is caused on this page the error text will not be read out automatically. This means that screen reader users will not be alerted to the message in the way they should be. This does not meet <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html">success criterion 4.1.3 (Status Messages)</a>.</p>

<p>We’re working with our supplier, Auth0, to resolve these issues as soon as possible.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Other issues</h4>

<p>There’s only one way to access the list of users in the form builder’s user management pages. This does not meet <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/multiple-ways.html">success criterion 2.4.5 (Multiple Ways)</a>.</p>

<p>We plan to resolve this by the end of 2024.</p>
