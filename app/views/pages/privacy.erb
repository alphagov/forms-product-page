<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Privacy notice: how we use your data</h1>

<p>Last updated: 22 July 2024</p>

<p>
GOV.UK Forms is a platform provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS), which is part of the Cabinet Office. The GOV.UK Forms platform lets UK government teams create online forms to collect information from people and organisations.
</p>

<p>
This privacy notice sets out what data we collect from you when you use the GOV.UK Forms platform, the GOV.UK Forms website (www.forms.service.gov.uk) and the services associated with them (together ‘GOV.UK Forms’). It also sets out what we do with that data.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data we collect from your users</h2>

<p>
Your organisation is the data controller for any data you collect through forms you publish using GOV.UK Forms. Cabinet Office - through GDS - is a data processor, collecting data on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
This privacy notice does not cover how we use data we collect from people who fill in forms you create with GOV.UK Forms.
</p>

<p>
How we use that data is covered in the standard privacy notice that’s created automatically when you publish a form, and linked to from the form’s footer. You’re also given the option of linking to information about what you do with user’s data once you receive it from GOV.UK Forms. Here’s an example showing how it works - <%= govuk_link_to "the privacy notice for the ‘Request an exemption from using the GOV.UK website’ form", "https://submit.forms.service.gov.uk/form/649/request-an-exemption-from-using-the-gov-uk-website/privacy" %>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data we collect from you</h2>

This privacy notice explains what personal data the Cabinet Office collects from you, as someone using GOV.UK Forms - for example, to create and publish forms. Cabinet Office is the data controller for this data. <%= govuk_link_to "Read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register", "https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053" %> for more information.

<p>The legal basis for processing this data is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>it’s necessary to perform a task in the public interest</li>
  <li>it’s necessary in the exercise of our functions as a government department</li>
  <li>consent (when you sign up to the GOV.UK Forms mailing list)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Data we collect when you use the GOV.UK Forms website</h3>

  <li>

</p>

<p>
We may also use this information to produce anonymised reports about GOV.UK Forms. This helps us understand where we can make improvements. We may share this anonymised information with other organisations in government so they can improve how they create forms.
