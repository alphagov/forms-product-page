# Accessibility statement for GOV.UK Forms
 
This accessibility statement applies to the:

- GOV.UK Forms website at [https://www.forms.service.gov.uk](https://www.forms.service.gov.uk)
- GOV.UK Forms platform at [https://admin.forms.service.gov.uk](https://admin.forms.service.gov.uk)

There's a separate accessibility statement for online forms created using the platform - that statement is linked to from individual forms.

There's also a separate [accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility-statement).

## Using the website and platform

The website and platform are run by GDS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use them. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
- zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website and platform using a keyboard or speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website and platform using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We've also made the text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible the website and platform are

We know that some parts of the platform are not yet fully accessible:

- there’s only one way for ‘super admin’ users to access the list of users in the form builder’s user management pages. Some people may find it harder to navigate to this page, as described under the heading 'Non-accessible content'.

## Feedback and contact information

We're always looking to improve the accessibility of the website and platform.

If you find any problems not listed on this page, or think we're not meeting accessibility requirements, email us at [govuk-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations').

If you're not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/), which is run on behalf of EHRC.
