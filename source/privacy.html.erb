<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Privacy notice: how we use your data</h1>

<p>Last updated: 8 June 2022</p>

<p>GOV.UK Forms will let UK government teams create online forms to collect information from people and organisations.</p>

<p>GOV.UK Forms is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) which is part of the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>Organisations that create online forms and collect personal data using GOV.UK Forms will be the data controller whilst the Cabinet Office, through GDS, will be the data processor. The data controller must tell you about what they are doing with your personal data.</p>

<p>This privacy notice explains what personal data the Cabinet Office collects and processes as a data controller through the GOV.UK Forms website.</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053">the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data we collect from you and what we do with it</h2>

<p>If you <a href="https://service.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cb74eb9a6898b0e5870fede0a&id=451fe4c1e1">register your interest in using GOV.UK Forms</a> we’ll collect your:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>organisation</li>
  <li>job title</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the Mailchimp platform to send email updates about GOV.UK Forms to you. This involves us sharing your email address with the platform provider, Intuit, as a data processor.</p>

<p>Intuit also collects some personal data via the Mailchimp platform as a data controller in their own right. For example, technical information about your device. For more information, you can read <a href="https://mailchimp.com/en-gb/legal/cookies/">Mailchimp’s cookie statement</a> and the <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/">Intuit privacy statement</a>.</p>

<p>If you email us about GOV.UK Forms, we’ll collect your email address and any other personal information you choose to include in your email.</p>

<p>The legal basis for processing this data is that it’s necessary:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>to perform a task in the public interest</li>
  <li>in the exercise of our functions as a government department</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
  <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h2>

<p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the law requires us to</li>
  <li>we need it for the purposes listed above</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that we will only hold your personal data for 2 years.</p>

<p>If you sign up to our mailing list, your personal data will only be retained while you choose to remain on the list.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>

<p>Your personal data may be transferred outside the United Kingdom while being processed by GDS. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level of technical and legal protection as you are within the United Kingdom by relying on the UK Government’s data adequacy decisions or by including clauses in contracts that require the recipient to protect the data in accordance with UK standards.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

<p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place technical and organisational procedures to secure the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with have an obligation to keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Children’s privacy protection</h2>

<p>We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy online. Our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.</p>
