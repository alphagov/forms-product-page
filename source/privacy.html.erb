<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Privacy notice: how we use your data</h1>

<p>Last updated: 16 September 2022</p>

<p>
  GOV.UK Forms lets UK government teams create online forms to collect
  information from people and organisations.
</p>

<p>
  GOV.UK Forms is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) which is part
  of the Cabinet Office.
</p>

<p>
  Organisations that create online forms using GOV.UK Forms are the data
  controller of personal data they collect using those forms, whilst the Cabinet
  Office, through GDS, is the data processor. The data controller must tell you
  about what they are doing with your personal data.
</p>

<p>
  This privacy notice explains what personal data the Cabinet Office collects
  and processes as a data controller through the GOV.UK Forms website and
  platform.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data we collect from you and what we do with it</h2>

<p>
  When you use the GOV.UK Forms service your device sends information such as
  your:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>web browser and version number</li>
  <li>time zone and language settings</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>give you the information and web pages you request</li>
  <li>monitor the use of the site for security threats</li>
  <li>
    monitor the performance of the site to identify inefficiencies and
    JavaScript errors
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We collect this information in system logs. These logs are stored in Amazon
  Web Services in Ireland.
</p>
<p>
  We move some of this information to our security and network monitoring tools
  in Ireland and the USA which are provided by companies acting as our data
  processors.
</p>

<p>
  We may also use this information to produce anonymised reports about the
  GOV.UK Forms service. This helps us understand where we can make improvements.
  We may share this information with the data controller of the form.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re a public sector employee and you request a GOV.UK Forms account
  we’ll collect your:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>name</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We use this data to ensure that only legitimate users of GOV.UK Forms can use
  it to create forms.
</p>

<p>
  If you
  <a
    href="https://service.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cb74eb9a6898b0e5870fede0a&id=451fe4c1e1"
    >register your interest in using GOV.UK Forms</a
  >
  we’ll collect your:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>organisation</li>
  <li>job title</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We use the Mailchimp platform to send email updates about GOV.UK Forms to you.
  This involves us sharing your email address with the platform provider,
  Intuit, as a data processor.
</p>

<p>
  Intuit also collects some personal data via the Mailchimp platform as a data
  controller in their own right. For example, technical information about your
  device. For more information, you can read
  <a href="https://mailchimp.com/en-gb/legal/cookies/"
    >Mailchimp’s cookie statement</a
  >
  and the
  <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/"
    >Intuit privacy statement</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  If you email us about GOV.UK Forms we’ll collect your email address and any
  other personal information you choose to include in your email.
</p>

<p>The legal basis for processing this data is that it’s necessary:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>to perform a task in the public interest</li>
  <li>in the exercise of our functions as a government department</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
  <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by
  court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Cookies</h2>
<p>
  We don’t use any cookies on the GOV.UK Forms website. However, Mailchimp uses
  cookies on the sign up page for our mailing list. We also use cookies to make
  the GOV.UK Forms platform work. For more information you can
  <a href="/cookies">read about the cookies we use</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h2>

<p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the law requires us to</li>
  <li>we need it for the purposes listed above</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that we will only hold your personal data for one year.</p>

<p>
  If you have a GOV.UK Forms account, your personal data will be retained while
  you continue to have an active account.
</p>

<p>
  If you sign up to our mailing list, your personal data will only be retained
  while you choose to remain on the list.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>

<p>
  Your personal data may be transferred outside the United Kingdom while being
  processed by GDS. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level
  of technical and legal protection as you are within the United Kingdom by
  relying on the UK Government’s data adequacy decisions or by including clauses
  in contracts that require the recipient to protect the data in accordance with
  UK standards.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

<p>
  We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. To prevent
  unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place technical and
  organisational procedures to secure the data we collect about you – for
  example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. We also make
  sure that any third parties that we deal with have an obligation to keep all
  personal data they process on our behalf secure.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Children’s privacy protection</h2>

<p>
  We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy online. Our
  services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years
  of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain
  data about anyone under the age of 13.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are your rights</h2>

<p>You have the right to request:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    a copy of that personal data - this copy will be provided in a structured,
    commonly used and machine-readable format
  </li>
